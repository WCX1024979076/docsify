##### 题目描述
We define B(x) as the number of digit 1 in the binary representation of x. For example, B(7) =B((111) 2 ) = 3, B(8) = B((1000) 2 ) = 1, B(9) = B((1001) 2 ) = 2.
We define F(x) = min{y j (y > x)∧(B(y)≤B(x))}. For example, F(4) = 8, F(5) = 6, F(6) = 8.
Zayin has a forest (a set of trees), whose nodes are numbered from 1 to n. For each node (e.g. node x),if F(x) is not greater than n, then the father of node x is F(x), else, node x is the root of a tree.
We use A [ i ] to denote the number of apples on the node i. Initially, all the A [ i ] (1≤i≤n) are equal to zero. In order to make his girlfriend happy, Zayin is going to perform magic on the tree. The magic consists of two types of operations:
1. Add x v : For every ancestor of node x (including itself), put v more apples on it. In other words, for every node (e.g. node y) on the path between node x and the root of its tree, let A[y] = A[y] + v.
2. Sum L R : Count the total number of apples on the nodes whose index is between L and R. In other words, you need to calculate .![在这里插入图片描述](https://img-blog.csdnimg.cn/img_convert/6eccfe0fff7e6b86f1b65014e432ce7a.png#pic_center)

##### 输入
The first line contains two integers n and m (1≤n≤1018 , 1≤m≤105 ), where n is the number of nodes and m is the number of operations.
The next m lines describe the m operations in order. Each line contains three integers. The first of them is op. If op = 1, then the next two integers will be x and v, representing an Add operation. If op = 2, then the next two integers will be L and R, representing a Sum operation. (1≤x≤n, 1≤v≤109 , 1≤L≤R≤n)
##### 输出
For each Sum operation, output one line including one number, denoting the corresponding result.
