##### 题目描述

You are given an integer n. Please output the answer of  ![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/09/29/oF5HEDpwS1tIlaP.png) modulo 998244353. n is represented in the form of factorization.

φ(n) is Euler’s totient function, and it is defi ned more formally as the number of integers k in the interval 1≤k≤n for which the greatest common divisor gcd(n,k) is equal to 1.

For example, the totatives of n = 9 are the six numbers 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8. They are all co-prime to 9, but the other three numbers in this interval, 3, 6, and 9 are not, because gcd(9,3) = gcd(9,6) = 3 and gcd(9,9) = 9. 

Therefore, φ(9) = 6. As another example, φ(1) = 1 since for n = 1 the only integer in the interval from 1 to n is 1 itself, and gcd(1,1) = 1.

And there are several formulas for computing φ(n), for example, Euler’s product formula states like:
![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/09/29/A5koZWXTrLBHN8E.png)

where the product is all the distinct prime numbers (p in the formula) dividing n.

##### 输入

The fi rst line contains an integer T (1≤T≤20) representing the number of test cases.

For each test case, the fi rst line contains an integer m￿(1≤m≤20) is the number of prime factors.

The following m lines each contains two integers pi and qi (2≤pi≤108 , 1≤qi≤108 ) describing that n contains the factor piqi , in other words, ![image.png](https://i.loli.net/2021/09/29/zw3xavC7GkQgh1Y.png). It is guaranteed that all pi are prime numbers and diff erent from each other.

##### 输出

For each test case, print the the answer modulo 998244353 in one line.

##### 提示

For first test case, n = 21*31= 6, and the answer is (φ(1)*n/1+φ(2)*n/2+φ(3)*n/3+φ(6)*n/6) mod 998244353 = (6 + 3 + 4 + 2) mod 998244353 = 15.

##### 题解

题目要求求解$F(n)=\sum_{d|n} \varphi(d)*\frac{n}{d}$，由于欧拉函数和$\frac{n}{d}$均为积性函数，则有

$F(m*n)=F(m)*F(n)$

即为$F( \prod p_i^{q_i})=\prod F(p_i^{q_i})$，则

$F(p_i^{q_i})=\sum_{d|n}\varphi(d)*\frac{n}{d}=\varphi(1)*n+\sum_{i=1}^{q} \varphi(p^i)*\frac{n}{p^i}=p_i^{q_i}+\sum _{i=1} ^{q_i}(p_i-1)*(p_i^{i-1}*\frac{p_i^{q_i}}{p_i})$

$=p_i^{q_i}+p_i^{q_i-1}*(p_i-1)*{q_i}=p_i^{q_i-1}*(p_i+q_i*(p_i-1))$

[问题 D: Master of Random](http://icpc.upc.edu.cn/problem.php?cid=2969&pid=3)

##### 题目描述

Hakase provides Nano with a problem. There is a rooted tree with values on nodes. For each query,you are asked to calculate the sum of the values in the subtree. However, Nano is a rookie so she decides to guess the answer. She has known how the data generator works: it identifi es the nodes with labels from 0 to n-1 and then visits them one by one. For each i (1≤i≤n), the generator selects a node whose label is smaller than i to be its father. The pseudocode is like this:

​     for i = 1 to n - 1:

​       father[i] = random(0, i - 1);

where random(a, b) randomly generates a uniformly distributed random integer in range [a, b].
Knowing n and the value of the i-th node ai , Nano decides to randomly choose a subtree and sum up all of the values in the subtree as the answer. Now Hakase wants to know what the expectation of the answer is. Can you help her?

##### 输入

The first line contains an integer T (1≤T≤10) representing the number of test cases.

For each test case, the fi rst line contains an integer n (1≤n≤100000), the number of the nodes in the rooted tree.

The second line contains n integers a0,a1,...,$a_{n-1}$ (1≤ai≤100000) represent the values of nodes.

##### 输出

It can be proven that the answer equals to an irreducible fraction p/q. For each test case, print $p*q^{-1}$ mod 998244353 in one line. $q^{-1}$ is the inverse of q under module number 998244353.

##### 提示

The shape of the tree in the first test case is unique. The father of node 1 is 0. It is possible to choose node 0 or 1 with equal possibility. The sum of the subtree with 0 as the root is 2 while the sum of the subtree with 1 as the root is 1. So the expectation is (2 + 1)/2 = 3/2. The output is 3*2-1 mod 998244353 = 400122178.

There are two possible shapes in the second test case, node 1’s father destines to be 0, but node 2’s father might be node 0 or node 1. Both conditions are equally possible.


If node 2’s father is node 0, we randomly choose a node. The sum of the subtree with node 0 as the root is 6. The sum of the subtree with node 1 as the root is 2. The sum of the subtree with node 2 as the root is 3.

If node 2’s father is node 1, we randomly choose a node. The sum of the subtree with node 0 as the root is 6. The sum of the subtree with node 1 as the root is 5. The sum of the subtree with node 2 as the root is 3.

So the expectation is (6 + 2 + 3 + 6 + 5 + 3)/6 = 25/6. The output is 25*$6^{-1}$ mod 998244353 = 166374063.

##### 题解

n个点可以形成树的种类为(n-1)!，然后随机选取一个点计算子树的权值，所以总共有n!种可能。

考虑每一个点对答案的贡献，即考虑每个点在所选出的子树中有多少种可能被包含。

$0: (n-1)!$

​	0点只有选取0这个节点时才会被选择，共有(n-1)!种形态的树，所以为(n-1)!

$1: (n-1)!+(n-1)!$

​	1点只有选取0和1这两个节点时才会被选择

$2:(n-1)!+(n-1)!/2+(n-1)!$

​	2点只有选取0点时和选取1点（2点不在0下面）和选取2点时才会被选择

...

$k:(n-1)!+(n-1)!/2+(n-1)!/3+....+(n-1)!/k+(n-1)!$

对于每一个点，假设k出现的种树为$cnt[k]=(n-1)!+(n-1)!/2+(n-1)!/3+....+(n-1)!/k+(n-1)!$，权值为a[k]，则对答案的贡献为$cnt[k]*a[k]*(n!)^{-1}$
